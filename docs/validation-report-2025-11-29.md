### Critical Failures
- No epics.md file exists (mandatory two-file output).
- No FR-to-epic/story traceability (coverage impossible).
- Stories/epics absent; cannot validate sequencing/vertical slicing.
- FR identifiers not in required FR-00X format.
- No references section citing source documents.
- Coverage gaps for growth/vision/innovation in FRs.

## Failed Items (Highlights)
- Provide epics.md with epics, stories, and acceptance criteria aligned to FRs.
- Add FR-00X identifiers and tag MVP/Growth/Vision where relevant.
- Add References section citing product brief and any other sources.
- Add explicit timer values/targets and edge cases (pause/app kill) in FRs or NFRs.
- Map growth/vision items to FRs or clearly mark as future.

## Partial Items (Highlights)
- Add measurable targets for timers/ad latency; clarify persistence/resume behavior.
- Add domain/competitor references to strengthen differentiation.
- Add MVP/Growth tagging and dependency notes where critical.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix:
   - Create epics.md with epic/story breakdown, acceptance criteria, sequencing, and FR traceability; ensure Epic 1 is foundation.
   - Add FR IDs in FR-00X format and tag MVP vs Growth vs Vision.
   - Add References section (product brief path, any research).
2. Should Improve:
   - Add timer values per difficulty, ad failover expectations (latency), and pause/resume edge cases.
   - Add coverage for growth/vision and innovation items in FRs or mark explicitly as future.
3. Consider:
   - Add UX principles section explicitly (feel/vibe, accessibility cues).
   - Add analytics/consent notes if instrumentation planned later.
