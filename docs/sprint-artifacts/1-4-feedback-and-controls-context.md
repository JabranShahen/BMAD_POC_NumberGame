Source: docs/epics.md (Story 1.4)  
PRD FRs: FR-010, FR-011, FR-015

Intent: Immediate visual feedback; optional sound/haptics toggles that persist; no crashes on devices without haptics.

Notes:
- Flash green/red + text cues; sounds/haptics behind toggles stored locally.
- Provide accessible text equivalents; persist settings via storage service.
