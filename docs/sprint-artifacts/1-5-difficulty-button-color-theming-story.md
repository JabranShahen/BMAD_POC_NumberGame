# Story: Difficulty Button Color Theming

Epic: Epic 1 - Core Gameplay Loop (Visual polish)  
Goal: Make each difficulty instantly identifiable via distinct palette-aligned fills.

Acceptance Criteria:
1) Fun button uses Seabrook #3F7BB9 with white text/icons; press darkens ~8–10%; focus ring gold #D6A21F.  
2) Medium button uses Harley Orange #D14A28 with white text/icons; press darkens ~8–10%; focus ring gold #D6A21F.  
3) Hard button uses Deep Navy #1F2F55 with white text/icons; badges remain gold/neutral and legible.  
4) All buttons keep AA contrast, minimum 48dp tap targets, and retain existing best/last badges.

Notes:
- Aligns with Sunset Punch palette; keep badges: gold #D6A21F (Best), neutral #F0F2F5 (Last).  
- Preserve gradient header and card spacing; adjust fills without reducing contrast.
