## Executive Summary

A fast-paced number puzzle game where players quickly spot the missing number in a sequence under time pressure, combining relaxing brain stimulation with AI-driven difficulty tuning. This serves as a great playground for exploring experiment-driven development using the BMAD method.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Many existing number puzzle games feel either too slow or too complex. They tend to require long attention spans or have cluttered interfaces. PuzzleGame fills the gap by offering quick, intuitive puzzles that deliver immediate satisfaction, without cognitive overload. It also addresses frustration caused by static difficulty — our vision is to let difficulty adapt dynamically to the player's performance, keeping the game challenging and fresh without becoming discouraging.

### Proposed Solution

PuzzleGame should feel light, immediate, and emotionally reactive. Instead of slow puzzle solving, the game delivers rapid-fire challenges with instant feedback: visual animations, sound reactions, and emotional face expressions. Progression should feel smooth and motivating, not punishing — players feel "in flow," not judged. The game is unique because it blends short-session play with a rewarding sense of improvement, and each round feels different due to dynamic difficulty, time pressure variation, and subtle psychological feedback cues.

### Key Differentiators

- Dynamic difficulty adaptation based on player performance
- Rapid-fire challenges with instant emotional feedback (animations, sounds, expressions)
- Flow-focused progression that feels motivating rather than punishing
- Short-session play with psychological feedback cues
- Variety in each round through time pressure and challenge variations

### Initial Vision

I'm building a fast-paced number puzzle game where players must quickly spot the missing number in a sequence under time pressure. I got excited about this because I love simple, clean brain games that you can play in short bursts, and I want to create something that feels both relaxing and mentally stimulating. It's also a great playground for trying AI-driven difficulty tuning and experiment-driven development with the BMAD method.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

PuzzleGame would be loved by casual players who enjoy mental stimulation during small breaks — like commuting, waiting in line, or relaxing at home. The ideal player might be someone who already likes brain training apps or quick logic challenges, but wants something lighter and more emotionally upbeat. They'd keep coming back because each session feels bite-sized and rewarding — they can play for 30 seconds or 10 minutes, see progress, and feel a small hit of satisfaction without stress or frustration.

## Success Metrics

I'd know PuzzleGame is working well if players naturally return to it regularly, even for short sessions. I'd love to see players improving over time as difficulty adapts to them, rather than plateauing or quitting. I'd be proud to see positive emotional reactions — people smiling, feeling clever, and experiencing small wins. I'd also look for strong play-retention over days/weeks, frequent replay-sessions, and feedback that the game feels both fun and mentally stimulating. Ultimately, success means the game becomes a habitual, satisfying little ritual in someone's day.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features

The one thing PuzzleGame must do is deliver quick, satisfying puzzle moments that feel fun and achievable in short bursts. The essential core features are: rapid puzzle presentation, instantly understandable choices, immediate feedback, and a clean interface with zero friction. Everything else — AI enhancements, progression features, visual skins, unlockables, social features — are nice-to-have additions for later. The core experience should simply be: open → instantly play → instant brain-reward loop.

### Out of Scope for MVP
