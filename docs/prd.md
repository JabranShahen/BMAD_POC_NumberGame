## Executive Summary

A fast-paced number puzzle game where players quickly spot the missing number in a sequence under time pressure, combining relaxing brain stimulation with AI-driven difficulty tuning. This serves as a great playground for exploring experiment-driven development using the BMAD method.

### What Makes This Special

- Dynamic difficulty adaptation based on player performance
- Rapid-fire challenges with instant emotional feedback (animations, sounds, expressions)
- Flow-focused progression that feels motivating rather than punishing
- Short-session play with psychological feedback cues
- Variety in each round through time pressure and challenge variations

## Success Criteria

Players naturally return to the game regularly, even for short sessions; Players improve over time as difficulty adapts to them, rather than plateauing or quitting; Positive emotional reactions — people smiling, feeling clever, and experiencing small wins; Strong play-retention over days/weeks, frequent replay-sessions, and feedback that the game feels both fun and mentally stimulating; Ultimately, success means the game becomes a habitual, satisfying little ritual in someone's day.
