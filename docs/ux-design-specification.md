## Executive Summary

funnums is a mobile missing-number puzzle built for fast, repeatable sessions. The UX centers on a frictionless loop: pick a difficulty, race a visible timer, see instant feedback, and loop back through a simple Game Over summary. Clarity (timer, lives, score), speed (auto-advance), and calm visuals keep players focused while subtle reward cues (sound/animation) reinforce progress.

---

## 1. Design System Foundation

### 1.1 Design System Choice

Hybrid native-first approach: follow iOS HIG and Material patterns for controls and navigation, with light custom styling (friendly colors, bold numeric typography) for game identity. Keep components minimal to prioritize clarity and speed; reuse platform defaults for dialogs, toasts, and lists to reduce risk and improve accessibility.

---

## 2. Core User Experience

### 2.1 Defining Experience

Defining loop: choose difficulty -> solve a missing-number puzzle under a visible timer -> get immediate feedback -> continue until lives expire -> view Game Over summary (score, best, solved) -> restart. Success hinges on instant comprehension (numbers legible, timer clear) and zero friction between puzzles (auto-advance on correct).

### 2.2 Novel UX Patterns

Animated emoji state avatar (Story 1.6) adds an emotional mirror that shifts with gameplay context without stealing focus from puzzle/timer. Behaviors: gentle idle per state, quick transitions (<=400ms) on lives/timer/game-over changes, then calm idle. Reduce-motion: auto-fallback to static PNG; respect OS setting. Palette: subtle Sunset Punch halo/ground so the emoji reads on light surfaces.

---

## 3. Visual Foundation

### 3.1 Color System (Sunset Punch palette)

- Primary CTA: Harley Davidson Orange #D14A28 (filled buttons, key CTAs)  
- Secondary / Ground: Seabrook #3F7BB9 with deep navy #1F2F55 for gradients/headers  
- Accent / Badges: Nanohanacha Gold #D6A21F (Best tags), neutral #F0F2F5 for ‚ÄúLast‚Äù  
- Surface / Background: Lynx White #F5F6F8; Cards white with soft shadow  
- Text: Electromagnetic #2B2F36 on light; white on dark/gradient headers  
- Error: #E44F4F (wrong answer, life loss)  
- Tone: bright, approachable; maintain AA contrast for all text/icon on fills.

**Interactive Visualizations:** Not generated in this pass.

## 4. Design Direction

### 4.1 Chosen Design Approach

Clean card-based layout with oversized numerals and prominent timer ring/bar. Portrait-only, single-column. Top bar: timer + lives + score. Middle: puzzle card with sequence and answer options. Bottom: discreet controls (sound/haptics toggle), minimal chrome. Feedback uses quick flashes and gentle haptics; avoid modal interruptions except Game Over. Ads only between sessions with a slim ‚ÄúNext round loading‚Äù gate. Difficulty screen uses Seabrook->deep navy gradient header, orange primary CTAs, and gold/neutral badges for Best/Last.

**Interactive Mockups:** Not generated in this pass.

### 4.2 Animated Emoji Avatar (Story 1.6)

- Placement: Difficulty screen hero card right/top aligned; Gameplay HUD left of timer (compact variant); Game Over large beside summary card. Keep puzzle/timer dominant; cap avatar size.
- States & mapping: Difficulty = face-grinning.json; Gameplay: 5=face-laughing/face-grinning, 4=face-smiling, 3=face-grimacing, 2=face-flushed, 1=face-fearful, timer<=3s=face-cold-sweat; Game Over=face-dizzy.
- Motion: Loop gently per state; transition between states in <=400ms with brief cross-fade/scale; after life loss, run the new state for ~2-3s then settle to idle. No screen shake.
- Accessibility & fallbacks: Honor OS reduce-motion; if true or asset load fails, show static PNG with same art. Semantic label example: "Player avatar worried, 1 life left, timer critical." Maintain contrast with soft halo.
- Performance: Preload current + next-likely state (life-1 and timer panic). Keep Lottie files small; cap avatar size to avoid jank on low-end devices.

## 5. User Journey Flows

### 5.1 Critical User Paths

**Journey: Start & Play (MVP)**  
1) Home: ‚ÄúChoose your challenge‚Äù + buttons Fun/Medium/Hard, show best and last score per mode.  
2) Difficulty: three cards with timer hints (Fun 8s, Medium 6s, Hard 4s) and best badges. Start launches puzzle.  
3) Puzzle: show sequence with missing slot, answer options, timer ring/bar, lives (5 hearts), score. Timer visible; expiry = mistake. Correct auto-advances; wrong animates and decrements lives.  
4) Game Over: summary (score, best, solved count), CTAs ‚ÄúPlay again‚Äù and ‚ÄúChange difficulty.‚Äù  
5) Ads gate (between sessions): ‚ÄúNext round loading‚Äù; if ad fails/offline, skip gracefully.

**Journey: History & Progress (MVP)**  
1) Home -> History: list per difficulty with last N scores, best, solved count.  
2) Empty state: ‚ÄúFinish a run to see your progress.‚Äù  
3) Return CTA to play again.

**Journey: Settings & Controls (MVP)**  
1) Header/overflow: toggles for sound and haptics.  
2) Note: applies immediately; persists across sessions.  

**Journey: Offline (optional)**  
1) Detect offline: banner "Offline ó puzzles still work."  
2) No blocking dialogs; play flow unchanged.  
3) When back online, nothing changes for gameplay (no network dependency).


**Journey: Emotional State Indicators (Story 1.6)**  
1) Enter Difficulty: avatar welcomes (face-grinning), sized as accent, not focal.  
2) Gameplay loop: avatar updates per lives/timer; urgency swap at <=3s.  
3) Life loss: swap to new state, brief attention draw (small scale + pulse), then return to idle.  
4) Game Over: face-dizzy beside summary; offers restart CTA nearby.  
5) Reduce-motion path: static PNG shown; no pulses.

## 6. Component Library

### 6.1 Component Strategy

Use native buttons, lists, modals. Custom/lightly styled components aligned to palette:  
- Puzzle Card: sequence layout with missing slot; responsive to varied number widths; missing cell tinted Seabrook 12% with feedback wash (primary tint on correct, red tint on wrong).  
- Timer Ring/Bar/Chip: primary tint base; urgency shift under 3s; chip uses subtle tint with high-contrast text.  
- Lives Indicator: 5 hearts; primary-colored active state; animates on loss.  
- Answer Options: large touch targets, filled primary buttons with white text; focus/press overlays.  
- Badges: ‚ÄúBest‚Äù gold (#D6A21F, white text); ‚ÄúLast‚Äù neutral (#F0F2F5, dark text).  
- Game Over Summary Card: white surface on Lynx White background; CTAs use primary filled and secondary outline.  
- Ads Gate Overlay: lightweight overlay with spinner/text; no modal blocks.

State considerations: default, press/hover (where applicable), active, error/wrong, success, disabled. Accessibility: visible focus rings on buttons, readable text labels on timers and feedback messages.

**EmojiAvatarWidget (Story 1.6)**  
- Props: `lives:int (0-5)`, `remainingSeconds:int`, `gameOver:bool`, `isDifficultyScreen:bool`, `reduceMotion:bool?` (defaults to OS).  
- Variants: Compact (HUD, 48-64dp) and Hero (difficulty/game over, 96-120dp). Left-align in HUD to avoid covering timer/puzzle.  
- States: welcoming, laughing, smiling, grimacing, flushed, fearful, cold-sweat (timer panic), dizzy (game over). Each with idle loop + micro-breathing when stable.  
- Behavior: Transition on life change or timer<=3; cross-fade/scale-in; cap animation burst to <1.5s before settling; do not block input.  
- Assets: Prefer Lottie in `assets/animated_emoji/`; fallback static PNGs in same folder; declare in `pubspec.yaml`.  
- Accessibility: Semantic label includes emotion + context (lives, timer). Respect reduce-motion; when true or asset load fails, show static frame without pulses.  
- Performance: Preload current and next-likely state; keep asset size small; avoid simultaneous large GIF/Lottie elsewhere.

## 7. UX Pattern Decisions

### 7.1 Consistency Rules

- Buttons: Primary = filled orange (#D14A28) with white text + visible focus ring; Secondary = Seabrook outline with light fill on press; Destructive (rare) = error red.  
- Feedback: Success inline flash + optional toast; Error inline flash/red + brief toast; Loading = spinner in overlays only. Emoji avatar mirrors state changes without blocking puzzle (life loss, timer panic, game over).  
- Forms/Inputs: Labels above; inline validation on submit or error; concise helper text.  
- Modals: Avoid during play; Game Over as full-screen sheet; minimal overlays only when needed (no ads gate).  
- Navigation: Single-stack portrait flow; back from difficulty to Home; in-run back disabled to prevent accidental exits.  
- Empty states: Friendly icon + single CTA.  
- Confirmation: Only for exiting mid-session (if enabled) or resetting data.  
- Notifications: Toast bottom for non-blocking info; short duration; screen-reader friendly text.  
- Date/time: Use relative timers with explicit seconds remaining.

## 8. Responsive Design & Accessibility

### 8.1 Responsive Strategy

Primary: mobile portrait.  
- Mobile: single column; bottom padding for safe areas; large tap targets (48dp).  
- Tablet: centered column with generous margins; larger puzzle card; optional split for history/details.  
- Desktop (optional): centered fixed-width column; same hierarchy.

Accessibility (target WCAG 2.1 AA):  
- Contrast: meet AA for text/icons; timer/lives states distinguishable by shape + color.  
- Keyboard/focus support for accessibility modes; visible focus rings.  
- Screen reader labels: timer, lives count, 'x lives left', 'correct/wrong', 'time's up', 'ad loading/skipped', emoji avatar emotion + context.  
- Touch targets: >=48dp; avoid tightly packed answers.  
- Motion sensitivity: honor OS reduce-motion; emoji avatar falls back to static frame; avoid shakes/flash.

---

## 9. Implementation Guidance

### 9.1 Completion Summary

- Core loops defined: start -> timed puzzle -> feedback -> summary -> restart (no ads in scope); Story 1.6 avatar mirrors state changes.  
- Components: puzzle card, timer, lives, answer grid, emoji avatar, summary card, toggles.  
- Patterns: primary/secondary buttons, inline feedback, non-blocking overlays, AA contrast, large tap targets.  
- Offline: gameplay continues without network; optional banner for awareness.  
- References: PRD/epics aligned; future hooks (leaderboard/daily/badges) remain hidden placeholders.
